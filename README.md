Question 1:
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room client is a company with a game called "Draw It or Lose It" that was already available on android. The client required a cross
platform server-client application for mobile and desktop that could be released in every store. The software itself was effectively one
gaming service that would use a stateless design to syncronize the games and pass relevent information to the user, these games would be 
tracked and handled by the server for the sake of unique game, team, and player ids.

Question 2:
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did a good job of evaluating the problem and finding an effective solution that would satisfy all the needs of the client and
lower their cost for development. Additionally I believe I did a fairly decent job of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the various
platforms for the server side and client side.

Question 3:
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document made laying out the basic framework and developing the code significantly faster and more efficient.
Knowing what needed to be built and how it needed to be structured before actually developing the code was extremely useful. Rather than
being in the wild west of coding with no real idea where you are going, having an outline is a nice change of pace.

Question 4:
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would likely revise the evaluation portion of the document as I think that I could more efficiently convey the information now and have a shorter 
more concise section that would clearly identify to others which platform is better in what regards (in relation to the application).

Question 5:
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

At the end of the day the end user is the make or break point of any application. I had to consider the clients needs and the needs of the users and find a
way to balancce those with realistic expectations. Luckily, this application was not some bleeding edge technology and there were many applicable solutions
available to choose from that would work. I found solutions to meet the needs of the user and chose the ones that seemed to fit the problem the best. If the
user doesn't like the product, or it does not meet their needs they will cease to be users.

Question 6:
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software by looking at what needed to be done, getting a game plan together in terms of how it should be done and what is the best way to
do so and then I executed the game plan, revaluating issues as they arose, or when it became apparent a solution was not as suited for the problem as it originally seemed.
In the future, while I may not need all the fields of a design document like the one here I intend to use some type of design document to streamline the process of developing 
the application. I definitely believe I need more practive with dropwizard before I attempt to use that in another application.
